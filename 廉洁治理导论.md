# Lecture 1 Definition of Corruption

## What is Corruption?

Does it have a unified definition?

Will corruption in one place not be corruption in another place?

## Historical Origin of the Concept of Corruption

柏拉图：所有部门利益占主导地位的政府系统都是腐败的；因此，需要一个理想的政体

Plato: All government systems dominated by departments' interest are corruptive. Therefore, an ideal polity is needed.

亚里士多德：“腐败”的政府服务于统治者的利益，而不是被统治者的利益

Aristotle: "Corrupt" government serves the interest of the ruler instead of the ruled.

马基雅维利：腐败导致失败，从而导致政府循环

Machiavelli: Corruption leads to failure, hence triggers a cyclical process of government transformation.

孟德斯鸠：腐败是意思功能失调的过程，良好的政治秩序被扭曲为邪恶的政治秩序，正如罗马共和国的衰落一样

Montesquieu: Corruption is the process of dysfunction, where good political order is twisted into evil one, as exemplified by the decline of the Roman Republic.

卢梭：政治腐败是权力斗争的必然结果，因此，权力使人腐败

- 腐败的政府违背了其与人民的契约，可以被人民推翻

Rousseau: Political corruption is the inevitable outcome of power struggle, hence power corrupts people.

- Corrupt government violates its contract with the people, and can be overthrown by them.

## Key Points of  the Classical Concept of Corruption

- “坏的政体(bad polities)”或政府要比个人腐败更具危害性
- 腐败的政治体系会摧毁人，而不是腐败的人摧毁政治体系
  - 这与现在的一般观念相反：政府官员的腐败
- 古典政治学的焦点：设计一个好的政治体系
- 阿克顿(Lord Acton)：“权力容易腐败，绝对的权力导致绝对的腐败。(Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.)”



- "Bad polities" or governments are more detrimental than personal corruption.
- Corrupt political system destroy people, rather than corrupt individuals destroy the system.
  - This is contrary to the common concept nowadays.
- Foci of classical politics: Design a good political system

## Modern Concept of Corruption

### Difference

- Classical: 以制度为导向；制度的衰败如何导致政府的失败

- Modern: 以行为为导向；政府官员如何利用公权力谋取私利

## Definition Based on Law

定义：如果一个官员的行为受到法律的禁止，那就是腐败；如果不受法律禁止，即使是不道德的行为，也不是腐败

- 优点：客观、直接、清晰、易于应用
- 问题：法律本身被腐败影响；法律的滞后性（导致其更宽容）
- Counterexample: Nazi official saved Jews after receiving their money; Government destroy houses of the poor and build extravagant ones for the officials, following the "city reconstruction plan"
- 此处的法律包括规章制度。特别地在中国，对于党员，党纪高于其他的法律。

## Definition Based on Public Interest

Definition: Any action that harms the public interest, even if legal, is corruption; In the other hand, if an action is good for the public, it shall not be considered corruption.

- Characteristic: Focus on the outcome

- Problem: What is public interest? Some corruption does not harm the public interest directly (e.g., bribes).

## Definition Based on Public Opinion

Definition: If the society condemns a certain action, and the actor feels guilt during it, then the action is corruption.

- "Black Corruption": Condemned by the most elites and public, and actor is wished to be punished
- "Gray Corruption": 
- "White Corruption": The majority of the public consider it tolerable
- Problem: The public opinion is not the same.

## Definition Based on Intention

Definition: When the public official pursues the maximization of personal income and interest, he is corrupt

- Problem: Not all maximization of interest is achieved by corruption; not all corruption involves personal interest; not very objective

## Widely-used Definition

在履行公共职责时，通过贿赂或恩惠败坏或毁坏廉政的行为来谋取私利。

滥用公职谋取私利。

腐败涉及公共部门官员（无论是政客还是公务员）的行为，通过滥用赋予他们的权力，为自己或与其关系密切的人不当和非法地谋取利益。

## Key Points

Corruption is the exchange of power and wealth.

Corruption does not have to happen between two people.

Utilizing public power to fulfill personal or **group** interest, is corruption.

Attention:

- **Public** and **Private** are hard to differentiate
- Interest can be intangible, long-term, scattered widely, or hard to be differentiated from legal actions
- Conditions contributing to corruptions might be "institutionalized", "standardized", widely-accepted, and even considered the code of conduct.
  - e.g., 百姓习惯了“办事需要塞红包”

## 中国对腐败的定义（理论上）

狭义：公职人员滥用公权力谋取私人利益

关键因素

- 重点是滥用公职
- 基于法律的标准

广义：将腐败的概念扩展到个人的道德行为。不仅只有违反法律的行为，还有违反社会道德惯例的行为

实例：贪污受贿、挪用公款、挥霍浪费、谋取特权、非法收入、官僚失职、谋取私利、违反会计准则、道德败坏、玩忽职守、懒政避责、逃税走私

- 失职、违反道德也被认为是腐败

### 相关术语

- 贿赂：向政府官员支付（金钱或物品）以谋取好处

- 贪污：公职人员窃取公共资源

- 诈骗：在处理金融资源时涉及欺骗、诈骗或隐瞒的经济犯罪

- 徇私、任人唯亲：基于特殊关系对某些人给予优惠待遇

- 裙带关系：特殊形式的徇私，官员给予自己的亲朋特殊利益

- 勒索：通过使用武力胁迫或威胁以索取金钱或服务

- 挪用：未经授权将公共资金用于其他目的

- 走私：贩运受管制货物以逃避关税或入境限制

- 挥霍

- 失职

- 道德败坏

## 小评

没有普遍接受的定义。在不同地区，合适使用的定义也不同（e.g., 中国有先锋队）

# Lecture 2 腐败的原因

## What is the "Causal Relationship因果关系"?

A leads to B; No A, no B

Clear causal mechanism and procedure

## Explanations to Corruption

### Moralism道德主义

Corruption is a personal moral issue

Insatiable greed (贪得无厌) leads to corruption

Focuses on the motivation of corruption

"Integrity is a virtue."

### Functionalism功能主义

Corruption is the biproduct of social economic development

The weak utilize corruption as an alternative to obtain interest in the rapid change of the society.

All in all, corruption is the "lubricant" of an inefficient government.

Corruption is the substitute of violence.

With the development of society, corruption gradually vanishes.

Criticism

- Ignore the long-term impact on the society.
- Failed to differentiate the interest of the few and the interest of the whole society.
- Will corruption vanishes as society develops?

### 组织主义方法

Based on Max Weber's theory of bureaucracy

Corruption is the organizational pathology病态 caused by bureaucratical structures.

"非货币定价法则"：Organizations that cannot receive service fee must designate non-monetary cost, impose it on the client as a service fee.

随着政府工作范围和规模的扩大，贿赂和裙带关系的机会也随之增加，因为不可能制定出满足各种情况的规章制度。

Criticism

- Larger organizations do not always corrupt more.
- Failed to explain why, in the same organization, some officials corrupts, while some don't.

### 经济学方法

Micro-economy: Corruption is a rational choice, after weighing the cost and outcome.

Macro-economy: Scarcity of resource leads to corruption, because the demand encourages the officials to corrupt.

### 委托代理方法

“代理关系”包括公众利益的委托人或监督人、代表委托人形式的代理人，以及与代理人建立委托关系的客户或私人。

- 代理人与委托人的委托关系并不绝对；代理人受到各方（上级、自身）的影响。

When the agent pursues its own interest rather than the one of the client, it corrupts.

Agent corrupts when:

- Agent is corrupted by the client.

- The expected benefit is higher than the cost.

Criticism

- Overly simplified the relationship between people.
- Structural 制度性的 constraints are ignored

#### Explanation of "Collective Behavior"

In some society, corruption is not an exception of rules, but a part of rules.

Corruption is tolerable and expected, and its benefit could overweigh the cost.

"If everyone corrupts, why I don't?"

Corruption is not only a fact, but also a way of life.

## Conclusion: Different Strata

1. Focus on personal factors

- 个人的不良行为和品德

2. Focus on structural factors

- 制度漏洞和监管不力

## Conclusion: Different Views

Societal, legal, economical, political, cultural...

## 案件报道中的常见原因

> 封建剥削制度（不劳而获）的影响
>
> 改革开放后资本主义腐朽意识的影响
>
> 思想教育不足导致金钱拜物教、享乐主义和过度自私
>
> 政治上不诚实，对党的事业不忠诚
>
> 规章制度的不完善

# Lecture 3 Characteristics of Corruption

## Questions

- What are the common forms of corruption?
- Why to study about them?
- Why do they change endlessly?
- What is the most common form of corruption?

## Political, Bureaucratic and Private: Who Corrupts?

### Political Corruption

High ranking officials utilize political power to maintain their power, status and wealth.

- e.g., election corruption

### Bureaucratic Corruption

Public administration, often in the process of conducting policies, officials utilize public power for their own benefits.

- e.g., bribery (as a taker), misappropriation, embezzlement

### Private Corruption

Bribery (as a giver), tax evasion, smuggling. Public servants may not be involved.

> In China, this kind of corruption is not paid much attention to in the past. Now, 黑名单制度 has been established.

## Individual and Collective: How Corruption Happens?

### Individual

Actions are illegal, secret.

### Collective

Due to the difficulty and risk, corruptions may need collective cooperation. However, the benefits and distributed among individuals.

## Private and Institutional: Who Benefits?

### Personal

For personal benefit

### Institutional

Have magnificent economic impact on organizations

- e.g., financial fraud

## Extraction (榨取) and Redistribution 

Corruption involves exchange, but the relationship may not be balanced.

### "Top-to-Bottom" or "Extraction"

Resources created by corruption flow from society to country

- e.g., Refinements, additional fees

### "Bottom-to-Top" or "Redistribution"

Resources flow from country to society

- e.g., tax evasion

## Coercion and Collusion (串通)

### Fraud and Coercion

- e.g., asking for bribery

### Collusion

Based on mutual consent

## Conclusion

1. Object: Political vs. Bureaucratic vs. Private
2. Method: Individual vs. Collective
3. Goal: Individual vs. Institutional
4. Flow: Redistribution vs. Extraction
5. Intent: Coercion vs. Collusion

## Changes of China's Corruption Forms

Corruption is one of the major challenges China face.

Corruption threatens the governance of the party, and is detrimental to the international image.

We paid much effort, as well as much price.

### From Fund to Capital

#### Fund Corruption

Embezzlement, luxurious consumption with public fund

- e.g., “三公”消费

Limits

- For enjoyment only, do not accumulate capital
- Easy to detect
- Conspicuous violation of the party's regulations

#### Capital Corruption

Transfer of national capital to individuals

Difference

- More production capital

Examples

>  企业重组
>
>  - 在资产评估中降低国有资产价值
>  - 为个人股设定高于国有股的利息率
>  - 只拆分个人股，不拆分国有股
>  - 建立“影子公司”
>
>  “政府创收”、“干部创业”
>
>  - 打造“副业公司”，干部“下海”创业，成为“红顶商人”
>  - 公共、政治领域，与私人、经济领域之间的区别逐渐消失
>  - 形成全新的、强大的、人脉广泛的新型商业精英
>
>  土地腐败
>
>  - 土地是最重要的国有资产
>  - 土地使用权转让：协商转让、招标
>  - 协商转让：政府（官员）有权决定是否、如何、向谁、以何种价格出租土地
>
>  评论
>
>  - 这些腐败不是中国独有的。但是考虑到国情不同，情况不一样
>    - 前共产主义国家：国有资产重组
>    - 土地公有？许多国家没有
>    - 西方资本主义国家也有，比如“旋转门”

### From Individual to Collective

#### Collective Corruption

Government officials collude with other officials or people outside of the government.

Involves many people, semi-public.

Conditions

- Related value or expected benefit is high
- Technical difficulties of corruption require more cooperation 
- The stakes are high, and the division of labor in responsibility is contributive to reducing risk

### From Domestic to International

Example

- Smuggling, money laundering, fleeing to foreign countries

> 洗钱的方法：地下钱庄、以幌子公司/亲朋的名义跨境汇款、境外融资中心、“窗口公司”
>
> 反腐败措施：公安部“猎户行动(Fox Hunt)”；多部门联合“天网行动(Sky Net)”；红色通缉令(Red Notices)

# Lec 4 Measurement of Corruption

透明国际：全球清廉感知指数

Transparency International: Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)

世界银行：全球治理指标

WB -- World Governace Indicators: Control of Corruption Estimates

## Questions

- Why is it hard to measure?
- What are the difficulties?
- Are there any objective measurement criteria?
- Why are the criteria important?
- How to relatively objectively and accurately measure the corruption?

## Can Corruption be Measured?

- “猖獗”“横行”等词语令人不能准确把握现状。
- Because of the complexity and 隐蔽性, there are few direct criteria.
  - Publicly reported cases; statistics

## Difficulties in Measurement

- Secrecy
- Lack of objective measurement
- Time and space variant
- Lack clear and uniformed definition

## Indirect Measurement

Government

- Record of official procrastination; methods of managing income; price model for procurement

Subjective indicators

- Public opinion on corruption, as "a good substitution of experiences"

Indexes

- CPI, WGI

Shortcomings

- Perceived high level of corruption may reflect high standards of moral norms
- No method is perfect

## Statistical Measurement

### "Objective" Measurement

Degree of Corruption

- Frequency; amount of money; cases where high officials are involved...

## Measurable Content

Recognition; tolerance; attitude towards anti-corruption education; confidence in government honesty; evaluation on government's anti-corruption efforts

Specifically:

- Social tolerance
- Political trust
- Public participation
- Confidence in anti-corruption

样本问题

> Q: 您认为以下哪些行为属于腐败？
>
> Q: “如果没有贿赂和腐败，就不可能做生意。”您是否同意这一说法？
>
> Q: 在过去三年里，您或者您做生意的朋友是否遭到政府官员的敲诈勒索？

## Zero Tolerance for Corruption Index (ZTCI) -- HK as an example

Major problems

- What is the young's tolerance towards corruption?
- What are the differences?
- How to explain the differences?

Measurement dimensions

- Take "Zero Tolerance" as a common self-recognition
- Zero tolerance in specific scenarios
- Zero tolerance shown in actions

> **General tolerance**
>
> Mean: 1.24
>
> - 0=totally intolerable, 10=totally tolerable
>
> **If you are aware that someone has committed corruption, would you report it?**
>
> Yes-No-Not Sure: 70%-10%-20%
>
> **Corruption tolerance in hypothetical statements**
>
> Using corruption as a means to a justifiable end is forgivable if there are no alternatives.
>
> Bribery may possibly improve efficiency in government.
>
> Corruption is unavoidable in human society.

# Week 7 Corruption and Economic Development

## Thought Questions

Are there any relationships between corruption and economic development?

What economic conditions are more contributory to corruption?

Can corruption have positive effect on economy?

Why do some countries encounter unprecedented corruption during rapid economic development?

## Measures of Economic Development

GDP; GDP per capita; PPP (purchasing power parity)

## Two Theoretical Questions

- What is the effect of economic development on the corruption?
- What is the effect of corruption on the economic development?

## I. Effects of Economic Development on Corruption

### Opinions

- More developed, less corrupt
- The people in the developing countries are not inherently prone to corrupt more than the ones in the developed
- The lack of development opportunities propels people to seek for other measures, including corruption
- The despairs caused by poverty forces people to abandon honesty and integrity
  - Recall: need-based corruption

### Logical Problems

The lack of opportunities and poverty is not always caused by poverty. It is more likely to be caused by increasing social and economic imparity.

- e.g., the poor are poorer, the rich are richer

The lack of opportunities and poverty does not always cause corruption.

- e.g., China before and after the reform and opening up. Abundant opportunities may lead to more greed and possibilities of corruption.

### A Deeper Look

"More developed, less corrupt" neglects the possibility that the majority of people don't benefit from the development.

Many poor people even don't have the resource (e.g., money) to corrupt.

Corruption is rooted in some highly industrialized and democratic countries (e.g., Japan, Italy).

"Good Governance善治": Economic development doesn't always bring good governance.

### Related Questions

Does the level of economic development affect the form of corruption?

Power pursues fortune (developing). Fortune pursues power (developed)?

## II. Effects of Corruption on Economic Development

### Positive

Simplify cumbersome bureaucratic regulations and ineffective law system.

Bribery as "speedy money" to reduce the large amount of time for handling permits and paper work.

Keep the balance of the supply and demand, because the companies with lowest cost (highest bribery) prevails.

### Negative (Prevailing Ideas)

Harms the economic development

- Undermine competition; Reduce efficiency; Hinder investment and growth; Undermine governance; Threaten legitimacy of the regime

Undermine public expenditure

1. Re-determine the official priorities of the government
2. Divert the allocated funds from their original purposes
3. Undermine the tax base

- e.g., Abuse of relief funds

### "Soft Ideas"

- Harsh anti-corruptions measure may delay economic growth.
- No back-door relationship, no business.
- If the profit increases, "public relation" cost is not so important.
- Corruption is the inevitable cost in the transformation towards market economy.
- Corruption for legitimate purposes can be tolerated.

## Conclusion: The Relationship between Corruption and Economic Development

It is hard to tell whether economic development will increase or reduce corruption.

But, corruption is more likely to be intolerable in developed countries.

Economic development does affect the scope and forms of corruption.

# Discussions

## 中国反腐成效如何

总体比较有成效

但是土木、外贸等领域改进可能不多

- 这些领域的腐败在全世界都是老大难问题

## 反腐力度较大的国家/地区

不同地区、不同时间的力度不同

真治理还是假治理？

- 有没有自我革命的决心？
- 反腐只是为了政治斗争？

e.g., 经济腾飞一段时间后的新加坡

- 贪污调查局

## 中国不同区域的腐败的区别

生产结构显著影响了腐败形式

- 山西煤矿生产：官商勾结
- 贵州较为贫困，金钱诱惑较大：受贿严重
- 沿海城市：外贸相关的腐败

# Week 8 Corruption and Democracy

## Discussion Problems

What is the major problem of corruption on democracy?

Why it seems that corruption surges in the process of democratization?

- Chaos in transformation
- More freedom of press engender more reports on corruption

Does democracy means less corruption? Will corruption decrease after democratization?

## What is Democracy?

Huntington (1991): 3 categories of the definition of democracy

1. **Source** of government's power
2. **Purpose** of government
3. **Procedure** of government

## Important Factors regarding Democracy

Competition: Meaningful and widespread competition between individuals and organized groups

Participation

Accountability

### Relationship

Competition => -- Monopoly

Participation => -- Discretionary power

Supervision => ++ Accountability

> Corruption = Monopoly + Discretionary power - Accountability
>
> (Klitgaard, *Controlling Corruption*, 1988)

## Democracy Helps Prevent Corruption

Balance the power

Evaluate and select officials

Have opportunities to report corrupt actions

Media is encouraged to expose corruption

## Democracy is Not a Panacea

Corruption within democracy systems

- elections, legislation, administration, judiciary

## Corruption in Elections

### More Possibilities for Corruption

- Candidates keep in touch with the voters and social media, which is an expensive action

- Most countries allow private campaign funding

- Wealth and power is connected

Campaign contribution can be bribery

Economic - money and political - votes exchange

## Corruption in Legislation

> Jackson for buying Alaska

## Corruption in Administration

For officials' own idea, "management field" and benefit

With the increase of scale and complexity, supervision is getting harder

"State capture", "regulatory capture"

- Supervisors are corrupted by the supervised

## Corruption in Judiciary

Judiciary Independence

- Not interfered by politics

Judiciary Accountability

- Responsible for their action
- Public and private action must comply with laws and moral rules

#### Laws Reform

Cultural Revolution; Rebuilding law system

## Law Reform as a Step Towards Democracy

Public "right awareness" grows

Public learns to protect their own interest with legal tools

Government and its officials should abide by the law

Clearly, good legal system can contain corruption

---

# Week 10 Corruption and Culture

## Discussion Questions

Are some cultures more likely to generate corruption?

If so, does it mean that corruption is a cultural tradition, hence is hard to diminish?

If not so, why is the corruption so common in some societies?

### Answer

Some cultural values may provide favorable environment to corruption.

- Paternalistic (家长式) management; personal trust network; guanxi network

## Paternalistic Management

The superior gives benefits to the inferior for their loyalty. A network bounded with the rulers is therefore established.

People with little power are willing to unconditionally accept the decisions from people with more power, hence no public participation is needed.

The inferior is more likely to show their loyalty to certain person.

## Personal Trust Network

In this culture, people usually don't trust "strangers" or "others".

For many people, their social world consists of very few people that can be highly trusted.

When people lack trust on others, they are more willing to build up their trust network.

## Guanxi Network

Maintaining the network requires mutual benefits.

When situation requires power beyond one's ability, guanxi is used.

- Relatives and Good Friends; Trusted Insiders; Others

## Confucian Values 儒家价值观

Confucianism stresses the importance of social relationship and collective.

五伦：君臣、父子、夫妻、兄弟、朋友

The Five Relationships: Ruler and Subject, Father and Son, Husband and Wife, Elder and Younger Brother, Friends

Social relationship is considered decisive in one's success.

>  “人情”、“报答”

> 官官相护；一人得道，鸡犬升天；厨房有人好吃饭，朝中有人好做官；一把伞遮一乡人；公章不如老乡；姑嫂亲，辈辈亲，砸碎骨头连着筋。

How do these values influence corruption?

- Social network based on personal relationships
- Instrumental use of social relationships
- Personal loyalty over ability and talent
