# Lecture 1 Definition of Corruption

## What is Corruption?

Does it have a unified definition?

Will corruption in one place not be corruption in another place?

## Historical Origin of the Concept of Corruption

柏拉图：所有部门利益占主导地位的政府系统都是腐败的；因此，需要一个理想的政体

Plato: All government systems dominated by departments' interest are corruptive. Therefore, an ideal polity is needed.

亚里士多德：“腐败”的政府服务于统治者的利益，而不是被统治者的利益

Aristotle: "Corrupt" government serves the interest of the ruler instead of the ruled.

马基雅维利：腐败导致失败，从而导致政府循环

Machiavelli: Corruption leads to failure, hence triggers a cyclical process of government transformation.

孟德斯鸠：腐败是功能失调的过程，良好的政治秩序被扭曲为邪恶的政治秩序，正如罗马共和国的衰落一样

Montesquieu: Corruption is the process of dysfunction, where good political order is twisted into evil one, as exemplified by the decline of the Roman Republic.

卢梭：政治腐败是权力斗争的必然结果，因此，权力使人腐败

- 腐败的政府违背了其与人民的契约，可以被人民推翻

Rousseau: Political corruption is the inevitable outcome of power struggle, hence power corrupts people.

- Corrupt government violates its contract with the people, and can be overthrown by them.

## Key Points of  the Classical Concept of Corruption

- “坏的政体(bad polities)”或政府要比个人腐败更具危害性
- 腐败的政治体系会摧毁人，而不是腐败的人摧毁政治体系
  - 这与现在的一般观念相反：政府官员的腐败
- 古典政治学的焦点：设计一个好的政治体系
- 阿克顿(Lord Acton)：“权力容易腐败，绝对的权力导致绝对的腐败。(Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.)”



- "Bad polities" or governments are more detrimental than personal corruption.
- Corrupt political system destroy people, rather than corrupt individuals destroy the system.
  - This is contrary to the common concept nowadays.
- Foci of classical politics: Design a good political system

## Modern Concept of Corruption

### Difference

- Classical: 以制度为导向；制度的衰败如何导致政府的失败

- Modern: 以行为为导向；政府官员如何利用公权力谋取私利

## Definition Based on Law

定义：如果一个官员的行为受到法律的禁止，那就是腐败；如果不受法律禁止，即使是不道德的行为，也不是腐败

- 优点：客观、直接、清晰、易于应用
- 问题：法律本身被腐败影响；法律的滞后性（导致其更宽容）
- Counterexample: Nazi official saved Jews after receiving their money; Government destroy houses of the poor and build extravagant ones for the officials, following the "city reconstruction plan"
- 此处的法律包括规章制度。特别地在中国，对于党员，党纪高于其他的法律。

## Definition Based on Public Interest

Definition: Any action that harms the public interest, even if legal, is corruption; In the other hand, if an action is good for the public, it shall not be considered corruption.

- Characteristic: Focus on the outcome

- Problem: What is public interest? Some corruption does not harm the public interest directly (e.g., bribes).

## Definition Based on Public Opinion

Definition: If the society condemns a certain action, and the actor feels guilt during it, then the action is corruption.

- "Black Corruption": Condemned by the most elites and public, and actor is wished to be punished
- "Gray Corruption": 
- "White Corruption": The majority of the public consider it tolerable
- Problem: The public opinion is not the same.

## Definition Based on Intention

Definition: When the public official pursues the maximization of personal income and interest, he is corrupt

- Problem: Not all maximization of interest is achieved by corruption; not all corruption involves personal interest; not very objective

## Widely-used Definition

在履行公共职责时，通过贿赂或恩惠败坏或毁坏廉政的行为来谋取私利。

滥用公职谋取私利。

腐败涉及公共部门官员（无论是政客还是公务员）的行为，通过滥用赋予他们的权力，为自己或与其关系密切的人不当和非法地谋取利益。

## Key Points

Corruption is the exchange of power and wealth.

Corruption does not have to happen between two people.

Utilizing public power to fulfill personal or **group** interest, is corruption.

Attention:

- **Public** and **Private** are hard to differentiate
- Interest can be intangible, long-term, scattered widely, or hard to be differentiated from legal actions
- Conditions contributing to corruptions might be "institutionalized", "standardized", widely-accepted, and even considered the code of conduct.
  - e.g., 百姓习惯了“办事需要塞红包”

## 中国对腐败的定义（理论上）

狭义：公职人员滥用公权力谋取私人利益

关键因素

- 重点是滥用公职
- 基于法律的标准

广义：将腐败的概念扩展到个人的道德行为。不仅只有违反法律的行为，还有违反社会道德惯例的行为

实例：贪污受贿、挪用公款、挥霍浪费、谋取特权、非法收入、官僚失职、谋取私利、违反会计准则、道德败坏、玩忽职守、懒政避责、逃税走私

- 失职、违反道德也被认为是腐败

### 相关术语

- 贿赂：向政府官员支付（金钱或物品）以谋取好处

- 贪污：公职人员窃取公共资源

- 诈骗：在处理金融资源时涉及欺骗、诈骗或隐瞒的经济犯罪

- 徇私、任人唯亲：基于特殊关系对某些人给予优惠待遇

- 裙带关系：特殊形式的徇私，官员给予自己的亲朋特殊利益

- 勒索：通过使用武力胁迫或威胁以索取金钱或服务

- 挪用：未经授权将公共资金用于其他目的

- 走私：贩运受管制货物以逃避关税或入境限制

- 挥霍

- 失职

- 道德败坏

## 小评

没有普遍接受的定义。在不同地区，合适使用的定义也不同（e.g., 中国有先锋队）

# Lecture 2 腐败的原因

## What is the "Causal Relationship因果关系"?

A leads to B; No A, no B

Clear causal mechanism and procedure

## Explanations to Corruption

### Moralism道德主义

Corruption is a personal moral issue

Insatiable greed (贪得无厌) leads to corruption

Focuses on the motivation of corruption

"Integrity is a virtue."

### Functionalism功能主义

Corruption is the biproduct of social economic development

The weak utilize corruption as an alternative to obtain interest in the rapid change of the society.

All in all, corruption is the "lubricant" of an inefficient government.

Corruption is the substitute of violence.

With the development of society, corruption gradually vanishes.

Criticism

- Ignore the long-term impact on the society.
- Failed to differentiate the interest of the few and the interest of the whole society.
- Will corruption vanishes as society develops?

### 组织主义方法

Based on Max Weber's theory of bureaucracy

Corruption is the organizational pathology病态 caused by bureaucratical structures.

"非货币定价法则"：Organizations that cannot receive service fee must designate non-monetary cost, impose it on the client as a service fee.

随着政府工作范围和规模的扩大，贿赂和裙带关系的机会也随之增加，因为不可能制定出满足各种情况的规章制度。

Criticism

- Larger organizations do not always corrupt more.
- Failed to explain why, in the same organization, some officials corrupts, while some don't.

### 经济学方法

Micro-economy: Corruption is a rational choice, after weighing the cost and outcome.

Macro-economy: Scarcity of resource leads to corruption, because the demand encourages the officials to corrupt.

### 委托代理方法

“代理关系”包括公众利益的委托人或监督人、代表委托人形式的代理人，以及与代理人建立委托关系的客户或私人。

- 代理人与委托人的委托关系并不绝对；代理人受到各方（上级、自身）的影响。

When the agent pursues its own interest rather than the one of the client, it corrupts.

Agent corrupts when:

- Agent is corrupted by the client.

- The expected benefit is higher than the cost.

Criticism

- Overly simplified the relationship between people.
- Structural 制度性的 constraints are ignored

#### Explanation of "Collective Behavior"

In some society, corruption is not an exception of rules, but a part of rules.

Corruption is tolerable and expected, and its benefit could overweigh the cost.

"If everyone corrupts, why I don't?"

Corruption is not only a fact, but also a way of life.

## Conclusion: Different Strata

1. Focus on personal factors

- 个人的不良行为和品德

2. Focus on structural factors

- 制度漏洞和监管不力

## Conclusion: Different Views

Societal, legal, economical, political, cultural...

## 案件报道中的常见原因

> 封建剥削制度（不劳而获）的影响
>
> 改革开放后资本主义腐朽意识的影响
>
> 思想教育不足导致金钱拜物教、享乐主义和过度自私
>
> 政治上不诚实，对党的事业不忠诚
>
> 规章制度的不完善

# Lecture 3 Characteristics of Corruption

## Questions

- What are the common forms of corruption?
- Why to study about them?
- Why do they change endlessly?
- What is the most common form of corruption?

## Political, Bureaucratic and Private: Who Corrupts?

### Political Corruption

High ranking officials utilize political power to maintain their power, status and wealth.

- e.g., election corruption

### Bureaucratic Corruption

Public administration, often in the process of conducting policies, officials utilize public power for their own benefits.

- e.g., bribery (as a taker), misappropriation, embezzlement

### Private Corruption

Bribery (as a giver), tax evasion, smuggling. Public servants may not be involved.

> In China, this kind of corruption is not paid much attention to in the past. Now, 黑名单制度 has been established.

## Individual and Collective: How Corruption Happens?

### Individual

Actions are illegal, secret.

### Collective

Due to the difficulty and risk, corruptions may need collective cooperation. However, the benefits and distributed among individuals.

## Private and Institutional: Who Benefits?

### Personal

For personal benefit

### Institutional

Have magnificent economic impact on organizations

- e.g., financial fraud

## Extraction (榨取) and Redistribution 

Corruption involves exchange, but the relationship may not be balanced.

### "Top-to-Bottom" or "Extraction"

Resources created by corruption flow from society to country

- e.g., Refinements, additional fees

### "Bottom-to-Top" or "Redistribution"

Resources flow from country to society

- e.g., tax evasion

## Coercion and Collusion (串通)

### Fraud and Coercion

- e.g., asking for bribery

### Collusion

Based on mutual consent

## Conclusion

1. Object: Political vs. Bureaucratic vs. Private
2. Method: Individual vs. Collective
3. Goal: Individual vs. Institutional
4. Flow: Redistribution vs. Extraction
5. Intent: Coercion vs. Collusion

## Changes of China's Corruption Forms

Corruption is one of the major challenges China face.

Corruption threatens the governance of the party, and is detrimental to the international image.

We paid much effort, as well as much price.

### From Fund to Capital

#### Fund Corruption

Embezzlement, luxurious consumption with public fund

- e.g., “三公”消费

Limits

- For enjoyment only, do not accumulate capital
- Easy to detect
- Conspicuous violation of the party's regulations

#### Capital Corruption

Transfer of national capital to individuals

Difference

- More production capital

Examples

>  企业重组
>
>  - 在资产评估中降低国有资产价值
>  - 为个人股设定高于国有股的利息率
>  - 只拆分个人股，不拆分国有股
>  - 建立“影子公司”
>
>  “政府创收”、“干部创业”
>
>  - 打造“副业公司”，干部“下海”创业，成为“红顶商人”
>  - 公共、政治领域，与私人、经济领域之间的区别逐渐消失
>  - 形成全新的、强大的、人脉广泛的新型商业精英
>
>  土地腐败
>
>  - 土地是最重要的国有资产
>  - 土地使用权转让：协商转让、招标
>  - 协商转让：政府（官员）有权决定是否、如何、向谁、以何种价格出租土地
>
>  评论
>
>  - 这些腐败不是中国独有的。但是考虑到国情不同，情况不一样
>    - 前共产主义国家：国有资产重组
>    - 土地公有？许多国家没有
>    - 西方资本主义国家也有，比如“旋转门”

### From Individual to Collective

#### Collective Corruption

Government officials collude with other officials or people outside of the government.

Involves many people, semi-public.

Conditions

- Related value or expected benefit is high
- Technical difficulties of corruption require more cooperation 
- The stakes are high, and the division of labor in responsibility is contributive to reducing risk

### From Domestic to International

Example

- Smuggling, money laundering, fleeing to foreign countries

> 洗钱的方法：地下钱庄、以幌子公司/亲朋的名义跨境汇款、境外融资中心、“窗口公司”
>
> 反腐败措施：公安部“猎户行动(Fox Hunt)”；多部门联合“天网行动(Sky Net)”；红色通缉令(Red Notices)

# Week 7 Corruption and Economic Development

## Thought Questions

Are there any relationships between corruption and economic development?

What economic conditions are more contributory to corruption?

Can corruption have positive effect on economy?

Why do some countries encounter unprecedented corruption during rapid economic development?

## Measures of Economic Development

GDP; GDP per capita; PPP (purchasing power parity)

## Two Theoretical Questions

- What is the effect of economic development on the corruption?
- What is the effect of corruption on the economic development?

## I. Effects of Economic Development on Corruption

### Opinions

- More developed, less corrupt
- The people in the developing countries are not inherently prone to corrupt more than the ones in the developed
- The lack of development opportunities propels people to seek for other measures, including corruption
- The despairs caused by poverty forces people to abandon honesty and integrity
  - Recall: need-based corruption

### Logical Problems

The lack of opportunities and poverty is not always caused by poverty. It is more likely to be caused by increasing social and economic imparity.

- e.g., the poor are poorer, the rich are richer

The lack of opportunities and poverty does not always cause corruption.

- e.g., China before and after the reform and opening up. Abundant opportunities may lead to more greed and possibilities of corruption.

### A Deeper Look

"More developed, less corrupt" neglects the possibility that the majority of people don't benefit from the development.

Many poor people even don't have the resource (e.g., money) to corrupt.

Corruption is rooted in some highly industrialized and democratic countries (e.g., Japan, Italy).

"Good Governance善治": Economic development doesn't always bring good governance.

### Related Questions

Does the level of economic development affect the form of corruption?

Power pursues fortune (developing). Fortune pursues power (developed)?

## II. Effects of Corruption on Economic Development

### Positive

Simplify cumbersome bureaucratic regulations and ineffective law system.

Bribery as "speedy money" to reduce the large amount of time for handling permits and paper work.

Keep the balance of the supply and demand, because the companies with lowest cost (highest bribery) prevails.

### Negative (Prevailing Ideas)

Harms the economic development

- Undermine competition; Reduce efficiency; Hinder investment and growth; Undermine governance; Threaten legitimacy of the regime

Undermine public expenditure

1. Re-determine the official priorities of the government
2. Divert the allocated funds from their original purposes
3. Undermine the tax base

- e.g., Abuse of relief funds

### "Soft Ideas"

- Harsh anti-corruptions measure may delay economic growth.
- No back-door relationship, no business.
- If the profit increases, "public relation" cost is not so important.
- Corruption is the inevitable cost in the transformation towards market economy.
- Corruption for legitimate purposes can be tolerated.

## Conclusion: The Relationship between Corruption and Economic Development

It is hard to tell whether economic development will increase or reduce corruption.

But, corruption is more likely to be intolerable in developed countries.

Economic development does affect the scope and forms of corruption.

# Discussions

## 中国反腐成效如何

总体比较有成效

但是土木、外贸等领域改进可能不多

- 这些领域的腐败在全世界都是老大难问题

## 反腐力度较大的国家/地区

不同地区、不同时间的力度不同

真治理还是假治理？

- 有没有自我革命的决心？
- 反腐只是为了政治斗争？

e.g., 经济腾飞一段时间后的新加坡

- 贪污调查局

## 中国不同区域的腐败的区别

生产结构显著影响了腐败形式

- 山西煤矿生产：官商勾结
- 贵州较为贫困，金钱诱惑较大：受贿严重
- 沿海城市：外贸相关的腐败

---

# Week 8 Corruption and Democracy

## Discussion Problems

What is the major problem of corruption on democracy?

Why it seems that corruption surges in the process of democratization?

- Chaos in transformation
- More freedom of press engender more reports on corruption

Does democracy means less corruption? Will corruption decrease after democratization?

## What is Democracy?

Huntington (1991): 3 categories of the definition of democracy

1. **Source** of government's power
2. **Purpose** of government
3. **Procedure** of government

## Important Factors regarding Democracy

Competition: Meaningful and widespread competition between individuals and organized groups

Participation

Accountability

### Relationship

Competition => -- Monopoly

Participation => -- Discretionary power

Supervision => ++ Accountability

> Corruption = Monopoly + Discretionary power - Accountability
>
> (Klitgaard, *Controlling Corruption*, 1988)

## Democracy Helps Prevent Corruption

Balance the power

Evaluate and select officials

Have opportunities to report corrupt actions

Media is encouraged to expose corruption

## Democracy is Not a Panacea

Corruption within democracy systems

- elections, legislation, administration, judiciary

## Corruption in Elections

### More Possibilities for Corruption

- Candidates keep in touch with the voters and social media, which is an expensive action

- Most countries allow private campaign funding

- Wealth and power is connected

Campaign contribution can be bribery

Economic - money and political - votes exchange

## Corruption in Legislation

> Jackson for buying Alaska

## Corruption in Administration

For officials' own idea, "management field" and benefit

With the increase of scale and complexity, supervision is getting harder

"State capture", "regulatory capture"

- Supervisors are corrupted by the supervised

## Corruption in Judiciary

Judiciary Independence

- Not interfered by politics

Judiciary Accountability

- Responsible for their action
- Public and private action must comply with laws and moral rules

#### Laws Reform

Cultural Revolution; Rebuilding law system

## Law Reform as a Step Towards Democracy

Public "right awareness" grows

Public learns to protect their own interest with legal tools

Government and its officials should abide by the law

Clearly, good legal system can contain corruption

---

# Week 10 Corruption and Culture

## Discussion Questions

Are some cultures more likely to generate corruption?

If so, does it mean that corruption is a cultural tradition, hence is hard to diminish?

If not so, why is the corruption so common in some societies?

### Answer

Some cultural values may provide favorable environment to corruption.

- Paternalistic (家长式) management; personal trust network; guanxi network

## Paternalistic Management

The superior gives benefits to the inferior for their loyalty. A network bounded with the rulers is therefore established.

People with little power are willing to unconditionally accept the decisions from people with more power, hence no public participation is needed.

The inferior is more likely to show their loyalty to certain person.

## Personal Trust Network

In this culture, people usually don't trust "strangers" or "others".

For many people, their social world consists of very few people that can be highly trusted.

When people lack trust on others, they are more willing to build up their trust network.

## Guanxi Network

Maintaining the network requires mutual benefits.

When situation requires power beyond one's ability, guanxi is used.

- Relatives and Good Friends; Trusted Insiders; Others

## Confucian Values 儒家价值观

Confucianism stresses the importance of social relationship and collective.

五伦：君臣、父子、夫妻、兄弟、朋友

The Five Relationships: Ruler and Subject, Father and Son, Husband and Wife, Elder and Younger Brother, Friends

Social relationship is considered decisive in one's success.

>  “人情”、“报答”

> 官官相护；一人得道，鸡犬升天；厨房有人好吃饭，朝中有人好做官；一把伞遮一乡人；公章不如老乡；姑嫂亲，辈辈亲，砸碎骨头连着筋。

How do these values influence corruption?

- Social network based on personal relationships
- Instrumental use of social relationships
- Personal loyalty over ability and talent

---

# 腐败与社会变革

## What is Social Change?

- Fundamental; Drastic change; Structural
- Mindset; Lifestyle



- Uncertainty; Chaos; Setback

社会转型意味着生活各个方面的重组，从文化到社会关系，从政治到经济，从我们的思维方式到我们的生活方式

## Irregular Control of Corruption

Uncertainty

- More opportunities for corruption (due to the lag of laws)
- More phenomena of new forms of corruption
- More chaotic social values
- Lack of government resources
- Increase in public demand and pressure

## Formal Rules vs. Informal Rules

### Formal Rules

有意识地指定，以书面形式编撰，并由外部权威机构强制执行

### Informal Rules

All (or most) actors consider that customs model and regional regulations are beneficial.

潜规则

### Common Phenomena during Social Change

- Rampant informal rules
- Develop even within formal rules
- Reject and replace formal rules
- Lead to the struggle between formal and informal rules
- Informal rules may transform into formal ones

### Example: 中国的公共采购

Develops due to the development of 合作治理

规则

- 公开竞标是政府采购货物和服务的默认方法
- 采购方式不得从公开招标改为邀请招标
- 禁止政府官员干预招标和投标过程
- 政府机构不得指定招标机构
- 公布采购结果，以便提出异议

规避

- 拆分大型采购项目，令各个项目不超过招标门槛

排挤

- 增加特殊要求使其有利于少数供应商

串通

- 在招标程序开始前联系政府官员
- 企业间串通：围标（某些企业提出高报价，令其他某个报价低的企业容易中标）

## 权力下放与腐败

- 中央政府向地区和地方政府下放权力

积极观点

- 改善治理的有效手段
- 将权力分散到职责明确的各级政府有利于减少腐败

消极观点

- 增加了地方官员与私人之间的接近程度

### 论述

不是权力下放的问题，方向是对的。是改革不彻底的问题。

- 虽然权力关系重新洗牌，但是权力规模并未缩小。——权力还是权力，还是能以权谋私，顶多换了人。
  - 差序格局：群众对地方腐败的感知较大。
- 在权力下放的过程中，政治与经济权力在地方一级进一步融合。
- 市场化位地方官员提供了更多寻租机会。

地方政府具有国家政治代理人和地方经济主体的双重身份。

### 结论

应当继续坚持推进权力下放。

权力下放过程应当包括：权力下放、向下问责、公众代表性

- @全过程人民民主
- 不能只看地方基层官员，还要看老百姓！

如果权力下放的三个方面不完整，那么权力易手后还是能成为个人贪污的工具。

## Discussions

### 一抓就死，一放就乱？

要摆脱抓乱闭环。要引入监察等机制。

现状：群众不了解或不关心。公示等制度效用不足。

# Week 12



## Definition of "Conflict of Interest"

## Conflict of Interest and Corruption: Relationship

- Conflict of interest is widespread and common
- Conflict of Interest is said to be the "prelude" of corruption: conflict of interest develops into corruption

## Categories of Conflict of Interest

- "Exchange": direct
- "Influence": direct or indirect
- "Revolving Door": indirect

## 案例分析

如果没有主动宣告和回避利益冲突，即使自己公正行事，也会影响参与方的声誉。

不举报腐败不但怂恿腐败，还会损害个人名誉和相关机构的威信。

发现腐败相关流言的时候，应当积极调查。即使没有真正腐败，这样的流言也会显著影响相关人员的声誉与威信。

## Management of Conflict of Interest

# Integrity Governance and the "Good Governance"

Government: 由有权管理的任何机构组成的治理机构

Governance: 治理国家、社会或组织的活动、方式、过程和结果

## Difference between Government and Governance

1. Governance involves organizations and actors other than government.
2. Governance commits the shared power and responsibility regarding solving social and economic issues.
3. Governance determines the power reliance among the organizations participating in collective actions. (Equal, shared, mutual reliance)
4. Governance involves the 自主自治网络(Autonomous Self-Organizing Network) of the actors
5. Governance believes that government can utilize new utilities and technologies for directions and guidance.

## Good Governance

Good governance focuses on the activities, methods, procedures and consequences of governance

Governance is: criterion, right, indicator, method.

Governance reflects the quality of governance.

## Theories

Fukuyama (2013):

>  评价治理质量的方法大致有四种：程序、投入、产出和机构自主

Rose-Ackerman (2017):

> 善治是指既能促进良好的实质性结果又能促进公共合法性的各种制度结构。治理改革的规范目标有两个方面：一式更有效的公共政策，二式合法并对公民负责的程序。“善治”一词常常与反腐败议程交织在一起。

Soren Holmberg and Bo Rothstein (2012):

> 善治不是一个功利主义的概念，而是以规范理论为基础，这些理论给出了应被视为“善”的一些方向。

## Indicators of Good Governance

Honesty, transparency, validity, accountability, public empowerment...

# Governance in Practice

## The Paths of Anti-Corruption Governance (Soft and Hard)

### Value-Based

Based on common value standards, with rules as assistance. When encountering moral dilemma, make choices based on widely-accepted value standards.

#### Limitations

1. Forms of corruptions and complex and varying. Rules cannot enumerate all things.
2. Latency
3. Difficulties and top-to-bottom supervision and accountability.
4. Lead to a cognition: Actions not forbidden by laws are allowed.

- “过多的规章制度或许会让人们只注意做事的规矩，而不关注做事的目的”

### Rule-Based

Based on rules, compliance-based. Punishment as a deterrence to prevent violation of rules.

#### Limitations

1. Hard to evaluate and differentiate.
2. Change may be slow.
3. Cannot leave the assistance of rules.

### Relationship of Two Paths

Effective anti-corruption governance system requires:

1. Approval of public values
2. Collaborations among...
3. ...

A society may lean to one path, but the two paths are not mutually exclusive.

We should consider them as a continuum (rather than diode).

### Example: Value-Based Path

Countries: Scandinavia, UK, Australia, New Zealand

Focus on the spread of public values, including transparency, integrity, equity, justice, rule of law. Embed them into public governance.

Their focus of anti-corruption is supervision rather than punishment, since corruptions are few.

This is a more advanced level. Nowadays, most countries are rule-based.

## Good Governance and the Prevention of Corruption

Good governance is determined by the introduction and adherence of values such as integrity and honesty.

Preventing corruption is the basic element of good governance. It is a necessary condition.

Benefits of anti-corruption on governance:

- Uncorrupted public servants team
- Improve moral atmosphere of marketing
- Increase the interaction between the government and public
- Gain support of public policies from the public

## Analysis of Hong Kong

腐败案例少、群众反腐败意愿高且有充分理由。

公务人员腐败少。多数贪污投诉都是针对私营机构的。

### Conclusion

廉洁治理应当追求更深层的社会价值观变化，具体体现在市民对廉洁的满意程度及获得感，对廉政建设的信心和信任，以及对腐败的零容忍

收获这些价值观念上的成果才是廉政治理的最终目标，而不仅仅是惩处腐败分子

由此，对包括廉政建设在内的所有公共治理提出了更高的要求：通过治理，共创有利于社会更快发展的公共价值观念。

# 反腐败战略

## 思考

- What is a good anti-corruption strategy?
- Why are the anti-corruption organizations important?
- How to measure the success and failure of anti-corruption?
- Why are some of the integrity strategy unsuccessful?
- Why should we analyze corruption control under the context of social governance?

## Categories

Highly integral

- New Zealand, Finland, Sweden, Australia, Norway, Singapore, Israel

Higher officials more corrupt than lower level officials

- South Korea, Brazil, Argentina, Japan(?), Newly industrialized countries

Lower level officials more corrupt than higher level ones

- India, Turkey, Countries democratized early but undeveloped in economy

Heavily corrupted. Also lag behind in political and economic modernization

- Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Nigeria, 喀麦隆, 津巴布韦, Dominic

## International Anti-Corruption Co-operation

### Organizations

UN, 经济合作与发展组织, World Bank, 国际货币基金组织、国际商会理事会, WTO

### Treaties

### 多管齐下的反腐败战略

Political accountability, Social engagement, Competition among private corporates, Institutionalized confinement for governments

### Top-to-Bottom & Bottom-to-Top

"Police patrol" & "Fire alarm"

Macro level systemic reform; Public anti-corruption awareness

## Institution Structure

No specified conduct organization

- Mongolia

Anti-corruption laws and several anti-corruption organizations

- India, Philippines

Specified and strong anti-corruption organization

- Hong Kong, Singapore, China

#### Opinions

Coordinated and strong efforts should be made. Hence China established a single, strong anti-corruption organization (纪检委). Research shows that around the world, this method is the most efficient.

## Differences in Anti-Corruption Organizations

### Structure

Nominated by head of the state/government.

### Independence

### Scope of Authority

Initiate investigations; Special investigation methods; Confiscation; Setting rules; Executive power

## Importance of Political Willingness

### 5 Indicators

1. Comprehensive anti-corruption laws
2. Enough personnel, budget, equipment and independence
3. Execute anti-corruption laws fairly
4. Not take anti-corruption as a method to suppress opposition
5. Government must sustain and monitor anti-corruption efforts

## 2 Dimensions of the Success of Anti-Corruption

### Dimension 1: Interior Anti-Corruption Capacity

Strong action against corruption

Integrity of the organizations

Timely respond to the demands from the society

Actively co-operate with the society

### Dimension 2: External Adaptivity and Change

Adapt to certain social environment. Change the environment.

### Structural Level

Action capacity; Response capacity; Participation capacity

#### 1: Action Capacity

- The most direct and evident indicator: Arrest, prosecute and convict corrupt officials
  - Percentage of conviction: India: 35%; Hong Kong: 64.65%
  - Due to judicial independence, the percentage cannot be very high

##### Power

- 逮捕权、调查权、搜查权、获取财产信息的权力、调查不明财产的权力

#### 2: Response Capacity

How do they respond to complaints?

- Hong Kong: 62%调查在9个月内完成；95%调查在两年内完成。完全实现48小时内与提出可追查投诉的投诉人取得联系。实名举报率达到70%；会询问是否需要提供安保支援。

#### 3: Participation Capacity

- 廉政公署：与约800个组织建立伙伴关系；每年为约四万名人员提供诚信培训；通过约30个商会，为银行、企业、投资者专门制定计划。

### Environment Level

Adapt; Change

#### 1: Adaptivity

Forms of corruption becomes increasingly complex. Must not rely on old or single anti-corruption strategy or method.

- Hong Kong: 开始对行为不当罪进行起诉

#### 2: Capacity to Change the Environment

##### Change People's Mind

>  Corruption is a little problem.
>
> Offering bribes is less harmful than accepting bribes, because the latter actors are government officials.
>
> Corruption in private sectors are less harmful, because only personal properties are involved.

#####  Transparency and Data Openness: The most common anti-corruption method

- Foundation of other measures

##### Collaborative Governance

##### Honesty/Integrity Education

## 3 Dimensions of Integrity Governance

全方位治理（不敢腐）、社会化参与（不想腐）、深层次预防（不能腐）

### 重在预防

案后预防

同步预防

- 关注重大工程

源头预防

- 审查系统与程序；利益冲突管理

## Others

Resources: 《腐败治理：概念、路径和方法》《直面挑战：香港反腐之路》《Corruption Prevention and Governance in Hong Kong》

## Discussion

### Who watches the watchdog?

外部监督：向议会负责（更接近人民）；香港的四大咨询委员会（在廉政公署上级），与廉署独立，主要由社会贤达组成；向司法部门、监察专员举报廉署

# 廉政治理：成功与挑战（课程总结）

## Major Challenges

量：只增不减，甚至越反越腐

质：不断呈现新的形式

资源问题：预算、人员……

社会层面：容忍度、满意度、信任度、支持度

## 2 Important Elements

Few countries succeed. Success is possible, with these necessary elements:

1. Strong anti-corruption **capacity**

2. High societal **trust** and support
   - This is probably more important.
   - Include: society has critical attitude towards corruption; public have trust in government

### Capacity and Trust: Closely Related, Not Always Synchronized

1. Capable, Trusted
2. Capable, Untrusted
   - Dictatorship. Capacity used for political suppression
3. Uncapable, Trusted
   - Newly decolonized countries in the 1960s. Underdeveloped yet highly anticipated
4. Uncapable, Untrusted

#### Capacity and Trust: Difference

##### Capacity

- Based out "output"
- Relatively objective
- Lack sustainability
  - e.g., The economy was affected heavily by the pandemic. The capacity is hence ineffective as a measurement

##### Trust

- Broader basis. Embedded in the society.
- Relatively subjective
- Relatively stable
  - Once established, the change is relatively small

#### Capacity and Trust: Which is More Important?

No widely accepted ideal.

无法相互替代，缺一不可，作用不同

两者互为因果，可以构成廉政建设中的良性循环。

> 循环
>
> - 反腐效能激发市民的信任
> - 市民信任激励廉洁治理效能

### Example: HK

群众信任廉署主要是因为其组织特点（人员清廉、组织独立、制度规范），而不是其效能。

信任度比对效能的评估高。

### Conclusion

区分效能和信任，两手都要抓

效能主要是“自上而下”，信任主要是“自下而上”。两者缺一不可。

两者互为因果而形成的良性循环非常有助于廉洁治理。

# 内地反腐进展

力度很大。立案数、处分人数均高。

## 一体推进三不腐措施举例

- 加大惩处力度
- 巡视巡察
- 作风建设、风腐一体化：看似是作风问题，其实可能是腐败问题
- “双规”、“留置”
- “四种形态”：不同问题有不同处理方式——“红红脸”；轻处分；重处分；移交司法机关
- 宣传教育
